===============================================================================


Playing the Game
----------------

Upon selecting the Play option from the main menu, you have a choice of either
Single Player or Multi-Player modes.

For Single Player mode, select your player and character using the left and
right buttons on the Player 1 controller and pressing fire.

In Multi-Player each player that desires to play must hit the fire key/button
on his controller in order to enter the game. From here each player can select
a player and character by using his left and right button, pressing fire to
select each. To cancel a selection, hit the jump button.

To delete unwanted players, press the Weapon Select button on your controller.
You will be prompted as to whether you want to delete it or not.

You may have noticed a character named "Custom" while browsing the characters.
If you select this character, a file select dialog will open allowing you to
import additional characters. Simply select the filename of the character you
want to load and hit the "Ok" button to load a custom character.

When selecting a character, you have the option to pick one at random. You can
do this simply by pressing Down. Pressing Up will select the Custom character,
allowing you to import an additional character from elsewhere on your computer.

Now you must choose a level. Use the Player 1 left and right buttons or the
keyboard left and right keys and press fire/enter to select the level. As for
characters, there is a "Custom" level which allows you to choose additional
levels you may have installed. Just select the file you want to load and hit
the "Ok" button.

As with characters, you may choose a level at random by pressing Down. Pressing
up will take you to the Custom level selection.

Note: all additional characters and levels that are in the Paintball Party
folder will be selectable as normal characters and levels. If you'd like your
additional characters and levels to appear in the selection arrays, be sure to
drop them in the folder where Paintball Party is installed.


Single Player Game Modes
------------------------

There are two single player modes in Paintball Party, the first being Scavenger
Hunt.

In Scavenger Hunt you must locate all five of the colored gems and bring
them back to the base (indicated by a green 'X'). The gems appear at random
locations and each gem must be brought back to base before another will appear.
You have 1 minute to find them all.

You say you're ready to use the paintballs. In Target Practice mode you get to
do just that. Locate the target and peg it with a paintball to make the next
target appear. Each time you hit a target another second is added to the clock.
When time runs out, your score and accuracy are displayed.


Multi-Player Game Modes
-----------------------

The multi-player modes are the meat of Paintball Party. There are 4 different
multi-player games, each of which can be customized using the menus. All modes,
with the exception of Hunter, can be played with a time limit if you'd like. If
you're playing with a time limit, the player that has the most points when time
is up wins.

Splat Fest is the most straightforward game mode. Just peg the other players
with paintballs and try to avoid being hit. When one player reaches the winning
score (as set in the menu), he wins.

Hunter is very similar to Splat Fest except that each player is allowed a cer-
tain number of hits before they are eliminated. The last player left is the
winner.

Paint Tag is based on the idea of Tag. One player is it and the others are try-
ing to avoid being tagged by that player. While you're it, your clock is tick-
ing. Once you reach the elimination time, you are out. To make the game fair,
all players are it at the start. When a player tags someone else, they are no
longer it. Only players that are it are allowed to fire paintballs. The last
player standing is declared the winner.

Capture the Flag is sort of a multi-player version of Scavenger Hunt. A flag
appears at a random location and you must find it and take it to base. If you
are shot while you have the flag, you drop it. Once the flag is delivered to
base, another will appear. This continues until a player has delivered enough
flags to win.


Game Statistics
---------------

In Paintball Party you have the ability to create your own player and build up
stats for accuracy and winning percentage. You can view these stats by
selecting the stats option from the Play menu. You can clear your player's
statistics by pressing the Delete key when viewing your stats.


Weapons
-------

There are 5 types of ammo in Paintball Party. You can enable or disable any of
the ammo types from the menus. Ammo types are as follows:

A - Normal
    Travels in a straight line until it hits something

M - Mines
    Sticks to the ground allowing you to set traps

B - Bouncing
    These bounce along until they hit a wall

S - Splitter
    Splits in 2 when it hits something, good for going around corners

H - Heat Seeker
    Homes in on the selected target

Ammo powerups respawn at the rate set in the menus.


Powerups
--------

There are a number of different powerups scattered throughout each level wait-
ing to be picked up. These provide some special abilities and are as follows:

R - Run
    Increase run speed

J - Jump
    Increase jump height

C - Cloak
    Makes you invisible and undetectable

D - Deflect
    Paintballs bounce off of you

F - Fly
    Allows you to fly
    
T - Turbo
    Allows you to fire paintballs rapidly

These powers wear off after 10 seconds. Powerups respawn at the rate set in the
menus.


Playing Tips
------------

With all the options available there are tons of different ways to play. Try
fiddling with the weapon and powerup options to find a mode that you and your
friends can agree on. Here's a game mode that we find to be a lot of fun:

Play Eliminator mode, giving each player 1 of each type of ammo, disabling ammo
respawning. Set the game to 1 Hit Elimination and remember to use that ammo
wisely!
