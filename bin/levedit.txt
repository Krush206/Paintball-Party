Getting Started
---------------

When Level Builder is started, you can either load an existing level or create
a new one from scratch. For your first time, we recommend loading the included
template level "template.ppl" and fiddle a little to get to know the program.


Things You Might Want to Know
-----------------------------

Levels are made up of a tileset, tilemap, and object map. All of these parts
are combined into one file format ("*.ppl"). You can also save the individual
parts using the export commands on the "File" menu.

The tileset contains 256 tiles, each of which is an animation. You can also do
tile animations that change one tile to another after a certain amount of time.
The tile properties dialog allows you to specify which side of each tile is
solid. You can also make a tile translucent. If you'd like to draw tiles in a
separate program, remember that all tiles are 16x16 and they must adhere to the
Paintball Party palette (they will automatically be converted if they don't).

The tilemap contains 5 layers, each with it's own scrolling speed. One layer,
which you specify from map properties, is the ILayer with which all the game
objects interact. You can also set the viewable map area using the XMin, XMax,
YMin, and YMax settings.

The object map is where you place all the player starting points, ammo, etc. Be
aware the a level needs, at the very least, starting points for the number of
players you want your level to support. If you try to play a level and you get
the message "Mode not supported!" your map lacks some object(s).

Adding Custom Music
-------------------

Paintball Party supports the following music formats:

IT, XM, S3M, MOD, MP3, OGG

The music file should have the same name as the level except with the proper
file extension for the format of the music. If the game doesn't find custom
music (or if the player has the Random Music option enabled), Paintball Party
will select a random song from within the game directory.
