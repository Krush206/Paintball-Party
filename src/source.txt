-------------------------------------------------------

This package contains all the source code from Paintball Party. Be aware that
you will need to have some additional libraries installed in order to compile
the sources.


Disclaimer
----------

NewCreature Design makes no gaurantees regarding the Paintball Party source
code. You may do whatever you wish with the code, however you are required to
notify us (e-mail todd@ncdgames.com) if you release a modified version of the
game. If you create a port of Paintball Party for another platform, please
include all the original documentation in the distribution.


Requirements
------------

GCC compiler (http://www.mingw.org)
Allegro 4.2 (http://alleg.sourceforge.net)
DUMB (https://sourceforge.net/projects/dumb)


Compiling
---------

Run "make" from the "src" subdirectory to build all the executables. These will
be placed in the "bin" subdirectory. You will (most likely) need to modify the
makefile if you are compiling on another platform.


Conclusion
-----------

It has been a great pleasure working on the Paintball Party project. We see no
benefit in keeping our source codes under wraps. If you have comments feel free
to contact us (e-mail todd@ncdgames.com) we'd be happy to hear from you. Happy
coding :)
