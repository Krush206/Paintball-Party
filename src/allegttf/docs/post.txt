Announce: AllegTTF version 1.9 available

What is ALLEGTTF

ALLEGTTF is a collection of functions to produce anti-aliased text 
output and TTF (True Type Font) loader, a GRX font loader and a bitmap 
font loader for use with Allegro and DJGPP.   Antialiased text means 
that fonts have 'soft' edges and blend into their backgrounds smoothly.  
Antialiased fonts are useful because the look a lot better than 
non-antialiased fonts, expecially at low resolutions/point sizes.

Version 2.0 is an Allegro 3.9.36 WIP compatibility update over 1.9.
