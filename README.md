## Notes:
For (old) binary releases of the game, [click here](https://ulozto.net/folder/SiFlXsG6bjwn).

The network play mode has been removed from the game since 1.4 release and is planned to be reimplemented. On older releases (1.3 and 1.35) it's rather laggy.
Although the network code has been enhanced on 1.4 beta release, this release has vanished and there's no single evidence of it in the net.

## Plans:
* Implement network play mode.
* Server finder list.
